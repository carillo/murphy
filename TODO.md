## Next Steps

Here are the remaining coding tasks the programming team needs to undertake:

* Improve shooter motor controller to allow on/off and speed tuning within target range
* Add on/off control to gear receptor latch servo
* Determine if video stream display window on driver station must be embedded into NI dashboard or if it can be an arbitrary app (such as VLC)
* Determine best strategy for autonomous time window, if team is in middle driving station
* Find the way to extend dashboard with mode control variable and how to control the mode switch
* Find out and implement the Python robotpy/wpilib code to read mode switch variable
* Implement and test autonomous mode(s)
* Find a reliable way to establish RoboRIO video feed to Dashboard
* Research how to receive additional video feeds from Jetson
* Setup Jetson to stream from two USB cameras
